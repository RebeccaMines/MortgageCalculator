# Mortgage-Calculator
A small program to calculate a mortgage based on user input.

## Description
When running this program the user will be prompted to enter the following information:
* Principal (between 1000 and 1_000_000)
* Annual Interest Rate (greater than 0 and less than or equal to 30)
* Loan Period (greater than 0 and less than or equal to 30)

If conditions are met, the program will then return the monthly mortgage payment and display 
the result as a currency.
